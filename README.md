# Active Editor Webstorm/IntelliJ Plugin

<!-- Plugin description -->
This simple Webstorm/IntelliJ Platform Plugin makes the current active editor in the IDE "stand out"; 
It does so by lightening (+10%) the current editor background color and 
by darkening (-5%) the background color of all the other editors currently open in the IDE.

This has the intended effect of increasing focus on the editor we're currently working with. 
Especially useful when working with many open editors.
